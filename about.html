            <p>My name is Nathan Wilson. I am a passionate full-stack web developer. In May of 2017 I graduated from Western Michigan University with a Bachelor’s Degree in Applied Behavioral Science. From there I began working at a staffing agency as a recruiter so I could pay my student loan bills. I liked it and I was good at it but deep down I always knew that it just was not for me. 
                <br>
                <br>
                In July on 2018 I began teaching myself HTML/CSS and a little JavaScript and quickly fell in love. In November of 2018 I began the Bloc coding bootcamp and began to realize that web development is my true passion. I have never felt so driven about one thing. Besides Bloc, I have used plenty of other resources such as freecodecamp, Udemy, Skillshare, Lynda, and YouTube to further my knowledge of web design and development. 
                <br>
                <br>
                My true affinity is for front-end design and development but I am far from afraid to get my hands dirty on the back end. Web design and development is my calling in life and I look forward to learning something new each and every day.
